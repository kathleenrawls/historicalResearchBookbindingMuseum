    "KR101": ["Roman Stylus", "Iron", "Unknown origin, 300 BCE - 470 CE", "The stylus was used for carving into wax tablets. It was a writing tool and an example of how early information storage was done as books began to emerge in ancient civilizations, especially Rome.", "From the London Museum"],
    "KR102": ["Wooden Writing Tablet", "Wood, wax", "Coptic Byzantine, 500 - 700 CE", "The wax tablet was one of the earliest examples of something resembling a book. In this example, the wooden panels were bound together and folded to create the shape of what we now recognize as a book, but with wax and wood instead of paper. It was more affordable and helped to make writing more efficient and accessible to the masses.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],
    "KR103": ["Book of the Dead", "Papyrus, ink", "Egypt, 332 - 200 BCE", "The book of the dead is an early example of a scroll. It demonstrates the earliest paper information storage and the inefficiency of searching for specific pieces of information. It was more expensive to produce at the time, which encouraged people to fit as much information into it as possible. The scroll would have to be unrolled, and would be difficult to search through for specific information.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],
    "KR104": ["Palm Leaf Fragment", "Palm leaf", "Nepal, 1680 CE", 'Palm leaves were used as an early form of information storage in 2nd century India BCE. While this example is from 1680, it still shows what a "page" would have looked like in this early example of bookbinding.', "From the University of Cambridge"],
    "KR105": ["Sinhala Palm Leaf Medical Manuscript", "Palm leaves, board", "Sinhala, 1700 CE", "This artifact shows the earliest form of something resembling bookbinding. Palm leaves were bound together with a cord through the center with cover boards to keep pages of information organized and protected. While they do not open with hinges in the way we currently think of books, this is where the concept of bound pages originated that paved the way for bookbinding to evolve.", "From the National Library of Medicine"],
    "KR201": ["Anaphora of the Virgin Mary", "Paper, board, cord", "Unknown origin, 17th century CE", "One of the earliest forms of sewing pages together was the coptic stitch, which is shown here as sewing the folios of text to each other and then to cover boards. While this is a 17th century example, the idea started in very early history, predominantly in North Africa. This method was commonly used in non-European bookbindings for centuries.", "From the Princeton Hand Bookbindings Collection"],
    "KR202": ["French Augustine Binding", "Paper, wood, cord", "Eastern France, early 12th century CE", "In early Europe, a method of sewing book spines was created known as supported sewing. Cords ran horizontally across the spine and were then anchored into wooden cover boards. This method was incredibly durable. This method was used across Europe and demonstrates the early emphasis on durability and protection in bookbinding.", "From the Princeton Hand Bookbindings Collection"],
    "KR301": ["Lindau Gospels", "Wood, silk, gold, silver, enamel, jewels", "Switzerland, c. 880 CE", "The Lindau Gospels is a very early example of decorative bookbinding, also known as treasure binding. These books were highly ornate, and were typically only used for religious texts as a way to celebrate it. Decorative bindings like treasure bindings were sought after by churches and monasteries for altars, and then by the wealthy elite.", "From the Morgan Library and Museum"],
    "KR302": ["Printed Book with Silva Nuptialis Bonis Referta Non Modicis", "Leather, printed paper", "France, 1521 CE", "This book is an example of medieval bookbinding techniques. It has a leather cover with some decorative details made only through blind tooling, or impressing designs into leather. This is a typical example of what some medieval binding would have looked like. The materials were good quality and focused on protecting the book while making the cover a little more decorative.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],
    "KR303": ["Book of Hours", "Tempera, gold, ink on parchment, red leather binding", "Belgium 1530 - 1535 CE", "The Book of Hours is an interesting example because it is bound somewhat simply, but durably. The book itself is also an illuminated manuscript. It demonstrates how a rise in illuminated manuscripts in the Middle Ages allowed for an increase in bookbinding as a whole, as people would generally want nicer copies of illuminated manuscripts that would hold up over time.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],
    "KR304": ["German Bible", "Leather, gold, brass, paper", "Germany, 1478 CE", "This German Bible is an especially good example of middle age bookbinding, as it has leather blind tooling details, is sturdy, and has metal work as part of it. There are also two clasp pieces on the edge of the book that would have been used to hold it closed to prevent the paper inside from warping over time. In the middle ages, there was a focus on durability in bookbinding that was characteristic of the age.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],
    "KR401": ["Bookbinding with Animals in a Landscape", "Paper mache, paint, gilded", "India, mid 16th century CE", "This book represents the combination of an emphasis on decorative bookbinding with fine skills and the decline in durable materials due to an increased demand for bookbinding following the invention of the printing press. The cover is ornately designed and gilded, but it also uses paper mache as a means of creating a cover in comparison to the wooden boards used in the middle ages.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],
    "KR402": ["Thesaurus de Sanctis", "Paper, leather", "London, 1537 CE", "The Thesaurus de Sanctis is an example of a book that was designed to appeal to broader audiences and gained popularity because of it, and it likely had a fairly simple cover design to be decorative without requiring as much time, another example of how an increase in demand for bookbinding was met. It uses blind tooling for the cover.", "From the London Museum"],
    "KR403": ["Propugnaculum catholicae veritatis", "Vellum, paper", "Ireland, 1669 CE", "This book is an example of a temporary cover, specifically one made of vellum. It was not as durable, and temporary covers were designed to protect the book over time, but eventually be rebound in a more personal way. Some temporary covers could be more well-made, demonstrating the continued emphasis on durability in bookbinding from the middle ages.", "From the National Library of Ireland"],
    "KR404": ["Gutenberg Printing Press Replica", "Wood, metal", "California, 1990 - 1999 CE", "The original press no longer exists, but replicas have been made. The Gutenberg Printing Press, while this one is only a replica, was one of the greatest innovations in literature. It is what caused an increase in bookbinding by adding printed books to the picture. It also increased accessibility. This is what marks the beginning of the incunabula period, the beginning of printed bookbinding.", "From the International Printing Museum"],
    "KR501": ["A Turnpike Lady", "Cloth, stamps", "New York, 1907 CE", "While significantly later, the turnpike lady serves as an example of the industrial revolution idea of uniform bookbinding. One could use stamps, and cloth was used more than leather. These designs were less personal and made for mass manufacturing and simplicity.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art Watson Library"],
    "KR502": ["Sonnets by William Wordsworth", "Sheepskin binding", "New York, 1891", "The binding on this novel represents the emphasis of the Arts and Crafts Movement on bookbinding, which lobbied for a return to the decorative fine arts of the middle ages. This book is made with leather and uses traditional gold tooling techniques.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art Watson Library"],
    "KR601": ["Villette Penguin Classics", "Bookcloth, vinyl, board", "Britain, 2016 CE", "On the internet, the penguin classics clothbound collection is one of the most praised as being a more traditional form of bookbinding. As people attempt to rebind their own books, many people emulate the style of designs to have complete collections.", "From my bookshelf / personal collection"],
    "KR602": ["They Both Die at the End Rebound", "Bookcloth, vinyl, board", "Virginia, 2024 CE", "This is an example of my own bookbinding work of contemporary novels, demonstrating the current accessibility of bookbinding. The materials are fairly basic, and vinyl is used instead of blind tooling or gold tooling, but it allows for interesting results nonetheless.", "From my bookshelf / personal collection"],
    "KR603": ["Weyward Rebound", "Fake leather, vinyl, board", "As an example of a modern approach to early bookbinding, we have this example that I also made. Rather than leather and gold tooling, this is also a fake leather cloth and a gold vinyl. These materials are less expensive, but they are more accessible to the everyday person and allow for a revival of designs inspired by the bookbinding of the middle ages. It serves as both a method of creative expression and preservation of books that use paperback covers.", "From my bookshelf / personal collection"],
    "KR604": ["The Book Jumper Paperback", "Paper", "New York, 2018 CE", "Paperback books are one of the most common forms of bookbinding available currently. However, they are most similar to the temporary covers of the past in that they function as covers to protect the paper, but they can also be removed to be rebound in a more durable way.", "From my bookshelf / personal collection"],
    "KR701": ["Embroidered Cover French", "Thread, embroidery", "France, 1776 CE", "Embroidered covers were used occasionally in bookbinding as a highly decorative technique. This one shows flowers and is a fairly simplistic design due to its repetition.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],
    "KR702": ["Embroidered Cover British", "Thread, embroidery", "United Kingdom, 1643 CE", "This example of embroidered bookbinding is highly decorative and ornate. Embroidered binding was typically used on religious books, and it was an interesting but uncommon form of binding.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],
    "KR703": ["Leather Cover Blind Tooling", "Leather", "North Africa, 14th century CE", "This is an example of blind tooling, which emerged early on in decorative bookbinding in the middle ages. Blind tooling involved impressing designs into leather with metal stamps. These would either be smaller stamps or larger ones that spanned the entire cover.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],
    "KR704": ["Leather Cover Gold Tooling", "Leather, gold", "Egypt or Syria, early 14th century CE", "This is an example of gold tooling, especially early gold tooling. When gold tooling was first in use, it was mainly used for accents rather than for full designs. Gold tooling was essentially just filling in the designs created with blind tooling with gold leaf.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],
    "KR705": ["Bookbinding of Repeat Foliate Pattern", "Thread, tapestry", "Britain, 1561 - 1613 CE", "The ribbon on this bookbinding is especially interesting in the context of bookbinding history. In the middle ages, some books used clasps to hold them closed and prevent the pages from becoming distorted as they aged. Once the paper changed to make them irrelevant, they continued to be used, but then ribbon was used as a replacement that was less expensive and equally decorative.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],
    "KR706": ["Pattern Block", "Stone", "Iran, 12th century CE", "This pattern block is an early example of something that may have been used for blind tooling on leather. Rather than a metal stamp, the stone plate could be pressed into the leather to create an impression.", "From the Metropolitan Museum of Art"],

    "KR708": ["Album Amicorum of Wolfgang Leutkauff", "Paper, leather, watercolor", "Turkey, 1616 - 1632 CE", "This is an example of marbled papers. Marbling is dye dropped across a liquid so it floats on the surface in a thin layer. A stylus is used to make marbled designs with the dye, and then a paper is laid across the top of the liquid to absorb some of the dye before it is dried and treated with a protective coating. These papers became the most common type of decorative endleaves, and different parts of the world developed their own techniques and styles of marbling. The practice started in the Middle East and was introduced to Europe through Arab traders.", "From the Victoria and Albert Museum"],
    "KR709": ["Curling Leaves and Buds Hand Stamps", "Wood, metal", "Unknown origin, unknown date", "These are small metal stamps used for blind tooling leather. They would have been used for smaller details and placed across the leather to create a unique design.", "From the Bookbinders Museum"],
    "KR710": ["Fore-edge painting of Sophocles", "Paper, gold leaf", "Britain, 1786 CE", "Edge decorations also grew in popularity in older books. While most used gilded edges, some used more unique methods. Fore-edge painting was a rare technique that used gilding on the flat edge before the edges were bent and painted, creating books that appeared gilded when closed but painted when open.", "From the Princeton Hand Bookbindings Collection"]
